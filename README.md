# The set of natural numbers

You are now experts on the various methods that can be used to represent the so-called natural numbers.  The natural numbers are the counting numbers starting from 1 (at least at Queens) and going up to infinity.  As you know, if we take two natural numbers and add them together we get another natural number.  Furthermore, if we take two natural numbers and multiply them together we get a natural number.  The set of natural numbers is thus said to be closed under the operations of addition and multiplication as we cannot create numbers that are not in the set of natural numbers by performing these operations on the members of set of natural numbers.

__To see if you understand this idea I would like you to complete the function called `isInNaturals` in `main.py`.  This function takes two natural numbers in input `a` and `b`.  The function should return 1 if `a-b` is in the set of natural numbers and zero if it is not.__
